# Getting Your Supabase Database Password

The Supabase CLI needs your database password to link to the remote project. Here's how to get it:

## Method 1: From Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pvbdrbaquwivhylsmagn
2. **Navigate to**: Settings > Database
3. **Look for**: "Database password" or "Connection parameters"
4. **Copy the password**

## Method 2: Reset Database Password

If you don't have the password:

1. **Go to**: Settings > Database in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Click**: "Reset database password" 
3. **Set a new password**
4. **Save it securely**

## Method 3: Use Connection String

Alternatively, we can use the full connection string approach:

1. **Get your connection string** from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
2. **It looks like**: `postgresql://postgres.pvbdrbaquwivhylsmagn:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`

## Once You Have the Password

Run this command with your actual password:

```bash
# Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] with your actual database password
supabase link --project-ref pvbdrbaquwivhylsmagn --password '[YOUR-PASSWORD]'
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
# Set password as environment variable
export SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD='your-password-here'

# Then link without password prompt
supabase link --project-ref pvbdrbaquwivhylsmagn --password "$SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD"
```

## Next Steps After Linking

Once the link succeeds, we'll run:

```bash
# Apply all migrations
supabase db push

# Verify what was created
supabase db inspect
```

Let me know when you have the password and I'll continue with the setup!
