    question: "What is the cost per session, and do you accept insurance?",
    answer:
      "Sessions are $150 for 50 minutes. I can provide a superbill if you’d like to request reimbursement through your insurance plan. I am not in-network with any insurance companies. Payment is due at the time of service.",

  {
    question: "What should I know about sessions?",
    answer:
      "All sessions are virtual and held through a secure platform called Simple Practice. Most sessions are 50 minutes, though we can explore shorter options if that feels more accessible. We’ll work together to find a pace and rhythm that fits your needs and capacity. Weekly therapy is not required.",

    question: "How do I get started?",

      "Start by submitting the contact form on my website. You’ll receive a follow-up email with a link to schedule a free 15–20 minute consultation. If it feels like a good fit, we’ll move forward with booking a first session.",
