    question: "What is a fit-or-free session?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long is the free consultation?",
    answer: "The free consultation is 15 minutes. It's a brief meeting to discuss your needs, my approach, and see if we're a good fit to work together."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during the consultation?",

    question: "Are sessions covered by insurance?",
    answer: "I’m not in-network with insurance providers. Sessions are $150 for 50 minutes, due at the time of service. If you’d like to use your out-of-network benefits, I provide a superbill, which is a detailed receipt you can submit to your insurance. Reimbursement varies by plan, but we make the superbill process simple so you have everything you need to try."
