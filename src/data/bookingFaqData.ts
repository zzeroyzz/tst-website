export const generalBookingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What is a fit-or-free session?",
    answer: "If your first full session after the free consultation doesn’t feel like a good fit, you won’t be charged for it. This ensures you only invest in an intake session that feels supportive and right for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use HSA or FSA funds for therapy?",
    answer: "Yes, therapy is generally an eligible expense for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). Since coverage details can vary, it’s best to confirm eligibility directly with your HSA/FSA provider."
  },
 {
    question: "Are sessions covered by insurance?",
    answer: "I’m not in-network with insurance providers, and sessions are $150 for 50 minutes. I provide superbills you can submit to your insurance for possible reimbursement, depending on your plan."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect from the free consultation?",
    answer: "It’s a quick virtual chat to share what you’re looking for, ask questions, and get a sense of how I work. If you’d like to move forward, scheduling is usually available right away."

export const affirmingBookingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What makes your practice affirming?",
    answer: "With lived experience and years of work in community care, I know how important it is to have a space where all of you is welcome. That includes LGBTQIA+ folks, BIPOC communities, non-monogamous people, and those who are multiply marginalized. Your identity is never something to be “fixed” or questioned here."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with people of all genders and sexualities?",
    answer: "Yes, I work with people across the spectrum of gender and sexuality. This includes trans and nonbinary folks, asexual and aromantic clients, and those questioning or developing identity. Therapy is a space where you don’t have to explain or defend who you are to be supported."

export const neurodivergentBookingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What does neurodivergent friendly mean in your practice?",
    answer: "It means I adapt therapy to work with your brain, not against it. That might include flexible pacing, breaking things into smaller steps, using visuals, making space for movement or stimming, or adjusting structure to fit what works best for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with ADHD and autistic clients?",
    answer: "I regularly work with ADHD, Autism, and AuDHD, as well as other forms of neurodivergence. Sessions can be adjusted in length or format if that makes therapy more supportive for how you process and engage."

export const traumaBookingFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What does trauma informed therapy mean here?",
    answer: "Therapy moves at your pace, with choice and collaboration at the center. I support trauma healing by working with your nervous system, helping release stored tension, reduce hypervigilance, and gently rebuild safety in relationships."
  },
  {
    question: "What approaches do you use for trauma therapy?",
    answer: "I completed training in integrative somatic trauma therapy, which includes Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Internal Family Systems (IFS), polyvagal theory, and attachment-focused approaches. These methods help connect body and mind, build nervous system safety, and gently process trauma at a pace that feels manageable."
