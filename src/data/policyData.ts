      Some crisis lines (not listed) are mandated to report calls to police if they perceive immediate danger to self. If concerned, first ask about their reporting policies before sharing. Please use all resources with discretion.<br/><br/>
      If considering 911 for immediate, life-threatening danger: be aware police lack mental health training and may pose risks to people with marginalized identities. If calling, we encourage involving trusted community members (friends, family, neighbors) for support.<br/><br/>
