  paragraphs: [
    'The people I work with often carry more than anyone realizes. They’re the ones others lean on, the ones who rarely have space to fall apart.',
    "I'm Kay (she/they), a Korean American, queer, neurodivergent therapist living with CPTSD.",
    'My work is shaped by my identities, lived experience, and the belief that care should hold all of who you are. As a Korean American, reconnecting with my culture has been a meaningful part of my healing. Being queer in Asian spaces and Asian in queer spaces has shaped how I hold complexity with care.',
    'My clients are the ones who always show up, even when no one asks how they’re doing. The ones who make space for everyone else but rarely receive it in return. Here, you don’t have to perform your pain or explain the basics of who you are. You get to bring your full self.',
    'My approach is trauma-informed, neuro-affirming, and identity-centered. I focus on nervous system safety and relational trust. We move at your pace and center what feels possible and needed for you.',
    'I do not separate healing from politics. I name and resist racism, colonialism, ableism, transphobia, and the systems that disconnect us from ourselves and each other. I believe that caring for ourselves is a form of resistance.',
    'Outside of sessions, I’m probably baking something random, tending to my plants, or singing dramatic karaoke in my living room. I spend a lot of time reading, getting into new craft projects, and learning how to keep things alive in the garden. Rest and joy matter to me.',
